Greetings and welcome. 

I develop in .NET almost exclusively for the past 10 years but have used .NET since 1.0. Along the way I've used RPG, 
Ruby, and a little Python and enough PHP to write a WordPress plugin.

In what little time I have I've been looking at functional programming. At least, looking at what is being added to C#.
I have a few books on F# but have thought about getting on the Rust bandwagon. 

I'm a big fan of PowerShell and have been proselytizing/advocating for years. Besides, you going to use Bash?

There's also some making stuff here and there. I've upgraded some 3d printers and build a few props that move or light up.
